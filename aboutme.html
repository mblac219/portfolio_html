                Hello. Thanks for checking out my website. Iâ€™m a freelance acrylic painter with a background in web and design. I live and work in Dallas, Texas. Here's a little more about me and my story.  I'm a retired disabled army veteran with 16 years of service which came to an end from a severe knee and leg injury in Iraq. To enjoy my down time during the rehab process I enrolled and finished my undergrad at Louisiana Tech University in Communication Design (Web & Graphic Design). I decided after maybe 5 years to get back into it and take it serious.  I'm currently on track to becoming a web developer. I practically spend every day experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Hopefully we can have a sit down and possibly work together
